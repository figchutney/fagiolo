# `fagiolo` ðŸ¥˜

A weekly meal choice automator ðŸ¤–ðŸ¥˜

Instead of having to try and remember which meals you like while planning your weekly menu, `fagiolo` allows you to randomly generate as many as you like (well, up to 14) from an ever-expanding bank of tasty meals (including the famous Oven Pizza). If you don't like any of them, you can swap them out for another.
